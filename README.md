### Childcare Affordability Challenges in the United States
**Project Overview:**  
This project analyzes childcare costs across the United States using the National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP). It examines geographic disparities, trends by age group and state, and affordability relative to median household income. Insights are communicated through an interactive dashboard, analytical report, and visual storytelling.  

**Tools & Technologies:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Tableau, Excel, Jupyter Notebook  

**Key Skills:** Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, data visualization, dashboard creation, policy-focused reporting  

**Outcome:**  
Identified key affordability challenges, including high infant care costs in states like California, Massachusetts, and New York, where expenses can exceed 25% of household income. Produced actionable visualizations and reports to inform policymakers, parents, and advocacy groups about childcare cost trends and disparities.

### House Price Prediction Using the Ames Housing Dataset
**Project Overview:**  
This project develops machine learning models to predict house prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. It explores key property features such as lot size, living area, neighborhood, and construction quality, applying data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation to generate accurate predictions.  

**Tools & Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook  

**Key Skills:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), model evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R²), data visualization, predictive analytics  

**Outcome:**  
Created predictive models that explain a significant portion of variance in house prices (R² ≈ 0.82). Identified key features affecting pricing, evaluated model performance with multiple metrics, and provided recommendations for improvement including advanced feature engineering, model tuning, and potential use of more complex algorithms like XGBoost or neural networks.

### Predicting Employee Attrition in Remote Work Environments
**Project Overview:**  
This project focuses on building a predictive model to assess the likelihood of employee attrition, particularly in remote work environments. By analyzing employee demographics, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and performance metrics, the model identifies key drivers of attrition and provides actionable insights for HR teams.  

**Tools & Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, Joblib  

**Key Skills:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, logistic regression modeling, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, HR analytics, predictive insights  

**Outcome:**  
Developed a logistic regression model to predict employee attrition with strong overall performance, achieving 90.14% accuracy and ROC AUC score of 0.7951. Key features, including role stability and interaction terms such as work-life balance × job satisfaction, improved predictive power. Analysis revealed younger employees, certain departments, lower job satisfaction, and longer commute distances increase attrition risk. Insights inform actionable HR strategies like engagement initiatives, career development, and flexible work policies.
